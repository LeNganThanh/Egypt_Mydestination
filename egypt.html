        <p>
          Egypt (Egyptian Arabic: "مصر" Masr; officially, the Arab Republic of
          Egypt, Arabic: جمهورية مصر العربية) is a transcontinental country in
          North Africa and the Middle East with its capital located in its
          largest city, Cairo. Egypt also extends into Asia by virtue of holding
          the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is bordered by Israel and the Gaza Strip to
          the north-east, by Sudan to the south and by Libya to the west. The
          country is bounded by the Mediterranean and Red Seas (to the north and
          east respectively) and geographically dominated both by the Nile River
          and its fertile well-watered valley, and by the Eastern and Western
          deserts. Egypt is perhaps best known as the home of the ancient
          Egyptian civilization, with its temples, hieroglyphs, mummies, and -
          visible above all - its pyramids. Less well-known is Egypt's medieval
          heritage, courtesy of Coptic Christianity and Islam - ancient
          churches, monasteries and mosques punctuate the Egyptian landscape.
          Egypt stimulates the imagination of western tourists like few other
          countries and is probably one of the most popular tourist destinations
          world-wide.

        <p>
          Ever since the 2011 revolution, tourism (which provides about 15% of
          employment in Egypt, so one-sixth of the population are reliant upon
          it) has taken a major hit. Because of the downturn in tourism, expect
          more persistent and aggressive touts, but prices are lower and you can
          avoid the gigantic crowds that, at other periods, were typically
          overflowing the marvellous sites. The more recent counter-revolution
          and Military putsch, like many events of its sort, has brought
          repression, death sentences and imprisonment for many Egyptians (and
          foreign journalists) but has resulted in lower crime and reduced
          disruption for well-heeled foreign tourists.

        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>
            Egypt is largely a desert, an extension of the great Sahara that bands North Africa. Save for the thin strip of watered land along the Nile River broadening into the Nile delta, very little could survive here. As the ancient Greek historian Herodotus stated: "Egypt is the gift of the Nile".

            Generally, the summers are hot and dry and the winters, moderate. November through March are definitely the most comfortable months for travel in Egypt. There is almost no rain in the Nile valley, so you won't need wet weather gear!
            
            The climate, however, does vary a little bit depending on where you are in the country. On the north coast along the Mediterranean Sea, a thin strip of land stretching from the sea to 50km southwards receives some of the most heavy rain in the country during winter months. Thunderstorms along with heavy rain showers that often last several hours are not uncommon here such as in Alexandria, Marsa Matruh and all other coastal areas, and even the Delta. In some years the rainstorms can last for a whole day or so, though the rain tends to be less heavy. Hail is also not uncommon, especially out in the desert where the weather is usually colder and allows for ice to fall and even frost to form on non-rainy days.</p>   
         <p>
            In the Sinai Mountains and also the Red Sea mountains, which stretch along the east side of the country along the shore of the Red Sea, there is generally more rain as rain clouds tend to develop when warm air evaporates and rises as it moves across higher terrain. Floods in these areas are a common weather phenomenon as so much rain can fall in a very short amount of time (often a day or two), with thunder and lightning as well. Because of the desert and lack of abundant vegetation, the water from the rain quickly falls down across the hills and mountains and floods local areas. In fact, every year there are stories in the local newspapers about flash floods in areas of the Sinai and also in Upper Egypt (southern Egypt) such as in Assiut, Luxor, Aswan, Sohag, etc. These floods, however, only generally happen two or three times a year, and often do not happen at all in some years, depending on the weather. When they happen though, it is often in early times of the season such as in September, October or late winter such as February or March (often the rainiest season in Egypt). Thus, one should be careful when venturing out into the desert or camping in certain areas as water can suddenly rush down from the nearby mountains and hills. It can sometimes carry a quite strong current that has been known to break down homes of rural people who build their homes from mud, bricks, and other weak materials. It is not surprising to hear that some people drown in the floods, which is strange for a desert country that doesn't receive much precipitation.</p>
            <p>
            Also, in higher elevations such as on top of the Sinai mountains, temperatures can drop much more than the surrounding areas, allowing for snowfall in winter months, since temperatures can drop down to below freezing, as well as formation of frost even in the low lying desert areas where the temperatures are generally several degrees colder than in the cities.
            
            December and January are usually the coldest months of the year, although it is normally warmer the further south you go and within the bigger cities.
            
            Visitors should be aware that most houses and apartments in Cairo and Egypt do not have central heating like countries with colder climates as the main weather concern in Egypt is the heat. Therefore, even though the weather might not be so cold for the Western traveller, inside the apartment it might be even colder as the temperature inside homes is generally a few or several degrees colder than out in the street.
