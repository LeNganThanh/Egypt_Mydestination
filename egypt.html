          Egypt (Egyptian Arabic: "مصر" Masr; officially, the Arab Republic of
          Egypt, Arabic: جمهورية مصر العربية) is a transcontinental country in
          North Africa and the Middle East with its capital located in its
          largest city, Cairo. Egypt also extends into Asia by virtue of holding
          the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is bordered by Israel and the Gaza Strip to
          the north-east, by Sudan to the south and by Libya to the west. The
          country is bounded by the Mediterranean and Red Seas (to the north and
          east respectively) and geographically dominated both by the Nile River
          and its fertile well-watered valley, and by the Eastern and Western
          deserts. Egypt is perhaps best known as the home of the ancient
          Egyptian civilization, with its temples, hieroglyphs, mummies, and -
          visible above all - its pyramids. Less well-known is Egypt's medieval
          heritage, courtesy of Coptic Christianity and Islam - ancient
          churches, monasteries and mosques punctuate the Egyptian landscape.
          Egypt stimulates the imagination of western tourists like few other
          countries and is probably one of the most popular tourist destinations
          world-wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since the 2011 revolution, tourism (which provides about 15% of
          employment in Egypt, so one-sixth of the population are reliant upon
          it) has taken a major hit. Because of the downturn in tourism, expect
          more persistent and aggressive touts, but prices are lower and you can
          avoid the gigantic crowds that, at other periods, were typically
          overflowing the marvellous sites. The more recent counter-revolution
          and Military putsch, like many events of its sort, has brought
          repression, death sentences and imprisonment for many Egyptians (and
          foreign journalists) but has resulted in lower crime and reduced
          disruption for well-heeled foreign tourists.

        <p>
          Egypt is largely a desert, an extension of the great Sahara that bands
          North Africa. Save for the thin strip of watered land along the Nile
          River broadening into the Nile delta, very little could survive here.
          As the ancient Greek historian Herodotus stated: "Egypt is the gift of
          the Nile". Generally, the summers are hot and dry and the winters,
          moderate. November through March are definitely the most comfortable
          months for travel in Egypt. There is almost no rain in the Nile
          valley, so you won't need wet weather gear! The climate, however, does
          vary a little bit depending on where you are in the country. On the
          north coast along the Mediterranean Sea, a thin strip of land
          stretching from the sea to 50km southwards receives some of the most
          heavy rain in the country during winter months. Thunderstorms along
          with heavy rain showers that often last several hours are not uncommon
          here such as in Alexandria, Marsa Matruh and all other coastal areas,
          and even the Delta. In some years the rainstorms can last for a whole
          day or so, though the rain tends to be less heavy. Hail is also not
          uncommon, especially out in the desert where the weather is usually
          colder and allows for ice to fall and even frost to form on non-rainy
          days.
          <img
            src="/image/egypt-map.jpeg"

            align="left"
          />
          In the Sinai Mountains and also the Red Sea mountains, which stretch
          along the east side of the country along the shore of the Red Sea,
          there is generally more rain as rain clouds tend to develop when warm
          air evaporates and rises as it moves across higher terrain. Floods in
          these areas are a common weather phenomenon as so much rain can fall
          in a very short amount of time (often a day or two), with thunder and
          lightning as well. Because of the desert and lack of abundant
          vegetation, the water from the rain quickly falls down across the
          hills and mountains and floods local areas. In fact, every year there
          are stories in the local newspapers about flash floods in areas of the
          Sinai and also in Upper Egypt (southern Egypt) such as in Assiut,
          Luxor, Aswan, Sohag, etc... These floods, however, only generally
          happen two or three times a year, and often do not happen at all in
          some years, depending on the weather. When they happen though, it is
          often in early times of the season such as in September, October or
          late winter such as February or March (often the rainiest season in
          Egypt). Thus, one should be careful when venturing out into the desert
          or camping in certain areas as water can suddenly rush down from the
          nearby mountains and hills. It can sometimes carry a quite strong
          current that has been known to break down homes of rural people who
          build their homes from mud, bricks, and other weak materials. It is
          not surprising to hear that some people drown in the floods, which is
          strange for a desert country that doesn't receive much precipitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, in higher elevations such as on top of the Sinai mountains,
          temperatures can drop much more than the surrounding areas, allowing
          for snowfall in winter months, since temperatures can drop down to
          below freezing, as well as formation of frost even in the low lying
          desert areas where the temperatures are generally several degrees
          colder than in the cities. December and January are usually the
          coldest months of the year, although it is normally warmer the further
          south you go and within the bigger cities. Visitors should be aware
          that most houses and apartments in Cairo and Egypt do not have central
          heating like countries with colder climates as the main weather
          concern in Egypt is the heat. Therefore, even though the weather might
          not be so cold for the Western traveller, inside the apartment it
          might be even colder as the temperature inside homes is generally a
          few or several degrees colder than out in the street.

          <h2>Ramandan</h2>
          <p>
            Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and the most
            important month in the Islamic Calendar for Muslims, the majority
            religion in Egypt. Commemorating the time when God revealed the
            Qur'an to Mohammed, during this holy month, Muslims abstain from
            eating, drinking or smoking until after sundown on each day.
            Although strict adherence to Ramadan is for Muslims only, some
            Muslims appreciate that non-Muslims do not take meals or smoke in
            public places. During Ramadan, many restaurants and cafés won't open
            until after sundown. Public transport is less frequent, shops close
            earlier before sunset and the pace of life (especially business) is
            generally slow. As expected, exactly at sunset minute, the entire
            country quiets down and busy itself with the main meal of the day
            (iftar or breaking-fast) that are almost always done as social
            events in large groups of friends. Many richer people offer (Tables
            of the Gracious God موائد الرحمن ) in Cairo's streets that cater
            full-meals for free for the passers-by, the poorer ones or workers
            who couldn't leave their shifts at the time. Prayers become popular
            'social' events that some like to enrich with special food treats
            before and after. An hour or two later, an astonishing springing to
            life of the cities takes place. Streets sometimes richly decorated
            for the whole month have continuous rush hours till very early in
            the morning. Some shops and cafés make the biggest chunk of their
            annual profit at this time of year. Costs of advertising on
            television and radio soars for this period and entertainment
            performances are at their peak.
